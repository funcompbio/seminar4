# Setup and background

* To follow these slides you need an installation of 
  [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).
  You should install R .boldface[first] and only once R has been installed,
  then you should install RStudio.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 
* You can find installation instructions in the
  [setup](https://funcompbio.github.io/setup/#r-and-rstudio) link on how to
  install R .boldface[and] RStudio in your system. Once R and RStudio are installed,
  you should be able to start RStudio by double-clicking on an icon like the
  one here below.

# Setup and background

We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and RStudio.
Please follow the next two steps:

1. Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at
   [https://dadescovid.cat](https://dadescovid.cat) and switch the language to
   "ENGLISH" using the pull-down menu on the top-right corner of the page.  
   &nbsp;&nbsp; 
2. Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download the file
   corresponding to the "7 DAY AGGREGATION" for "CATALUNYA".
   Make sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file
   has been downloaded. .boldface[Tip:] some browsers automatically download files
   into a folder called "Downloads" or under a name corresponding to the
   translation of "Downloads" to the default language of your operating system.

---

# Setup and background

* Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your _home_ directory,
  called `seminar4` and copy in it the downloaded file.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress it so that you finally
  have a file called `catalunya_setmanal.csv` in the directory `seminar4`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* If you are using the UPF [myapps cloud](https://myapps.upf.edu) to run
  RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in _myapps_ to
  download the data file directly in the _myapps_ cloud or upload to the
  _myapps_ cloud the file that you have downloaded in your own computer.

# Starting R and RStudio

* RStudio is the most popular graphical user interface (GUI), or rather the most
  popular
  [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment),
  for working .boldface[with] R. However, RStudio .boldface[is not] R.
  RStudio .boldface[runs] R. You can also run and work with R .boldface[without] RStudio.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* If you need to work with R in a remote server, then either that remote server runs
  [RStudio server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server) and you
  can connect to it through a web browser or, alternatively, you only have a text-based
  connection through a terminal window and then you .boldface[cannot] use RStudio but
  your can use R on the Unix command-line.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* If for whatever reason, you cannot use RStudio, you can still follow these
  slides, skipping the parts that specifically refer to the GUI of RStudio.

---

# Starting R and RStudio

* The RStudio window is initially divided in three main panes:

.pull-left[
* .boldface[R shell:] where you can interactively type R commands.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* .boldface[Environment / history:] where you can browse through the
  objects that are being created and the commands that you have
  typed in the R shell.
]
.pull-right[
![](img/RStudioFreshStart.png)
]

* .boldface[Files / plots / pkgs / help:] where you can navigate through
  the filesystem where RStudio is running and change the working
  directory, visualize plotting output, browse through the loaded
  packages and read help pages.

---

# Starting R and RStudio

* If you cannot start RStudio but you have installed R, you still can start
R by typing on the Unix shell command line:

    <pre>
    $ R
    </pre>

* Your terminal window should then be running R and looking similar to the one
  below.

# Quitting R and RStudio

* To quit R and RStudio you should type the following instruction in the
R shell:
  <pre>
  > q()
  </pre>
* You should .boldface[not] type the `>` character, since it corresponds to the R
  prompt and only indicates that the given instruction to the right of that
  character should be typed in the R shell. Normally, after that instruction
  R will ask:
  <pre>
  > q()
  Save workspace image? [y/n/c]:
  </pre>
* If you answer `y` then R will store all the objects you created in a
  hidden file called `.RData` and next time you start R, all those objects will
  be automatically loaded.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* In general, there is no reason to save the workspace when you quit R, so you
  should always answer `n` to that question; answer `c` _cancels_ the
  quitting instruction.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* In RStudio you can also quit R and RStudio by either closing the application
  window or through the `Quit` option in the _File_ or _RStudio_ top-level menu.

---

# R as a calculator

* The R shell can be directly used as a calculator, type the following
  instructions and figure out what the operators do:
<pre>
> 1+1
> 5-4
> 3*2
> 6/2
> 4%%3
> 2**3
> 2^3
</pre>

---

# R as a calculator

* Type the following and press enter:
<pre>
> 1+
</pre>
* You should have obtained the following output:
<pre>
&gt; 1+
+
</pre>
where the cursor is next to the plus sign (`+`) that has appeared in the
line below. This plus sign indicates that the expression you have written
is incomplete.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* This often happens when there is, for instance, a missing
closing parenthesis. In this situation you can do two things: (1) you
complete the instruction or (2) you press the `Esc` key, which will cancel
the instruction. Try cancelling this incomplete sum with the `Esc` key.

---

# RStudio contextual help

* Try to calculate the natural logarithm of 10 by typing:
<pre>
&gt; log(10)
</pre>
  If you are using RStudio, note that when you have typed the name of the
  function `log`, RStudio shows you a popup with contextual help, which
  you can use to choose among functions that have `log` as a prefix in their
  name.

# Getting and setting the working directory

* Whenever we want to read or write data files to a specific working directory,
we need to make sure that the default directory access or R is pointing to that
directory, just as with current working directory (CWD) in the
Unix filesystem.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* To find out the default working directory of R, you should call the `getwd()`
  function in the R shell:
  <pre>
  > getwd()
  </pre>
* If the returned path is not the working directory that we want, we can change it
  with the function `setwd(dir)` where `dir` should be the path that we want to
  set as working directory.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;

---

# Getting and setting the working directory

* In RStudio, using the _Files_ pane, we can navigate through the file system to
  the directory we want to set as working directory and then click on the `More`
  pull-down menu and select `Set As Working Directory`.  

![:scale 50%](img/RStudioSetWorkingDirectory.png)

* Using the function `setwd()`, or the RStudio _Files_ pane, change the working
  directory to the path `seminar4` that you should have created at the beginning
  of this practical and where you have downloaded the file `catalunya_setmanal.csv`.

# Reading CSV files

* We can read CSV files in R using the function `read.csv()`. Let's read the CSV
  file `catalunya_setmanal.csv` as follows:
```{r}
dat <- read.csv("catalunya_setmanal.csv", sep=";", stringsAsFactors=TRUE)
```
* Note that when writing the first letters of the filename, you can
  _autocomplete_ the rest of the filename by pressing the `TAB` key.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Next to the filename as a first argument, we also specified that the column
  delimiter in `comarques_setmanal.csv` is a semicolon `;` and that we want R
  to treat character columns as a special kind of object called _factor_.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* The `read.csv()` function in R is analogous to the `read_csv()` function
  in the Python module _pandas_.

---

# Reading CSV files

* The `read.csv()` function returns a `data.frame` object. You can verify it by
  typing
```{r}
class(dat)
```
* Figure out the dimensions of this `data.frame` object with the function `dim()`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* Examine the first and last rows of this `data.frame` object with the functions
  `head()` and `tail()`.  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
* If you are running RStudio, go to the `Environment` pane
  and click on the small right triangle icon next to the object name and then over
  the object name.

---

class: small-code

# Reading CSV files

* A quick way to get a summary of the data stored in a `data.frame` object is
  by calling the function `summary()` with that object as argument. Call `summary()`
  on the previous `data.frame` object and you should be getting an output similar
  to this one:
```{r}
summary(dat)
```

---

# Subsetting rows of a data frame

.boldface[Exercise:] Using the previously loaded `data.frame` object, build a
vector of logical values (a so-called _logical mask_) in one-to-one
correspondence with the rows, where a position in the vector is `TRUE` if the
corresponding row contains data belonging to the general population, i.e.,
excluding geriatric residences; see section on _Subsetting_ from
[this lecture](https://funcompbio.github.io/lecture6).
If you store that _logical mask_ into an object called `mask`, the sum of its
truth values should give the following result:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mask <- dat$RESIDENCIA == "No"
```
```{r}
sum(mask)
```

Using that logical mask, obtain a new `data.frame` object that includes only
data rows from the general population. Verify that the number of rows in the
new object matches the sum of `TRUE` values in the logical mask.


---

# Simple plotting

* The main function to plot data points in (base) R is the function `plot()`.
  Type the following call to the `plot()` function in the R shell:
```{r, out.height="250px"}
x <- 1:10
plot(x, 2*x)
```
* Repeat again the last call adding the argument `type="l"`. What did this
argument change? Is there a value for the parameter `type` that allows one
to plot both, dots and lines? 

---

# Simple plotting

.boldface[Exercise:] Using the `data.frame` object with COVID19 data from the general population
obtained in the previous section and the `plot()` function, try to reproduce
the **shape** of the plots shown at the front page of the Catalan COVID19 data
portal at [https://dadescovid.cat](https://dadescovid.cat). It is not
necessary to reproduce details such as colors, axis labels and legends, a
single solid line showing the shape of the plotted values is enough.
